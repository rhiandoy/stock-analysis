# VBA Challenge Stock Analysis
Module 2

## Project Overview
    For this challenge, we were given the task of refactoring the code that we created in
    module 2 using the VBA editor in Excel. The main goal was to edit the code to create 
    a more efficient output for others who might need to view a greater volume of data on the stock market. We revised
    the original variables and loops to accomplish this goal and execute our code in a quicker time frame.
    
## Results
  Following the general structure of coding patterns, we began by adding the variable tickerVolume as a long data type as well as two single types (startingPrice & endPrice). We needed to change our previous code to increase the stock ticker volume. When running the macro for either selected year we received a pop up showing the more efficient run time.

   While we were altering the original code, our output to the "All Stocks Analysis" worksheet remained the same which was expected.

 ## Summary
 ### Refactoring Code
      The obvious advantage to refactoring code is making it more comprehensible for other users as well as ourselves.
      Refactoring the code can help execute the task with less steps. A major disadvantage,
      which I experienced first hand, is how time consuming changing the code can be to make it run how you want. 
      I experienced many small errors that would cause the macro to run improperly. Fortunately, the VBA program highlighted the problem areas so it was easier to fix the issue.
